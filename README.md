Leapfrog Prototype

Leapfrog is a game where you take control of a frog and attempt to reach the end of the level by jumping around the environment.  You as the player must navigate the environment with the might of you jump alone.  This version has only a prototype of the full intent for the controls, making it possible to use an unintentional range of movement.   

Our stand-in goal point is a small horse which sits at the top of the map

**The controls for the game are as follows :**
Motion [ W,A,S,D ] ( Unintentional )
Jumping [ Spacebar ] ( The mechanic the game must rely on to be successful )
View Control [ Mouse Movement ] ( Looking around )
Zoom [ Mouse2 ] ( Right click )
